# GTK Layer Shell

![GTK Layer Shell demo screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/dIuYcBM.png)

A library to write [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) applications that use [Layer Shell](https://github.com/swaywm/wlr-protocols/blob/master/unstable/wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1.xml). Layer Shell is a Wayland protocol for desktop shell components, such as panels, notifications and wallpapers. You can use it to anchor your windows to a corner or edge of the output, or stretch them across the entire output. This library only makes sense on Wayland compositors that support Layer Shell, and will not work on X11. It supports all Layer Shell features including popups and popovers (GTK popups Just Workâ„¢). Please open issues for any bugs you come across.

## To install
1. Clone this repo
2. Install build dependencies (see below)
3. `$ meson build -Dexamples=true -Ddocs=true`
4. `$ ninja -C build`
5. `$ sudo ninja -C build install`
6. `$ sudo ldconfig`

### Build dependencies
* [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) (>=0.45.1)
* [libwayland](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland) (>=1.10.0)
* [GTK3](https://www.gtk.org/) (>=3.22.0)
* [GObject introspection](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gobject-introspection/)
* [GTK Doc](https://www.gtk.org/gtk-doc/) (Optional)

#### Install dependencies on Ubuntu 18.04 and later
```
sudo apt install meson libwayland-dev libgtk-3-dev gobject-introspection libgirepository1.0-dev
```

### Options
* `examples`: If to build gtk-layer-example and if to build and install gtk-layer-demo (default false)
* `docs`: If to generate the docs (default false)

## To use
* `gtk-layer-demo` is installed if examples are enabled. Its UI exposes all features of the library, and it's useful for testing layer shell support in compositors
* [gtk-layer-shell.h](include/gtk-layer-shell.h) contains the full API
* [example/example.c](example/example.c) is a minimal working app
* [demo/](demo/) contains the code for `gtk-layer-demo` (a more complex app)
* The easiest way to build is to use the `gtk-layer-shell-0` pkg-config package. Refer to your build system or the pkg-config docs for further instructions
